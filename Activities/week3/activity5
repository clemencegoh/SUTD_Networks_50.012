1. 5 packets max

3. Remaining packets are not acknowledged, and are discarded.

4. Window advances. All packets have been acknowledged.
Receiver does not have to acknowledge every packet, only the last one.

5. Selective repeat sends all within the window, then only resends
request for packets which did not get an ack within the timeout.
The window moves forward only when the first packet in that window
has been received. There are unnecessary retransmissions when ack is killed.

6. Both uses the "window" concept which allows for re-assembly of
data packets to send to the upper layer in its proper order.
This is due to the window not moving so long as the first packet is not received.
