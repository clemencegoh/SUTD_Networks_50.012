# Industrial Control networks

- Making Systems which have airtight security
    - Emphasis on having **control**
        - Sensors (to observe/monitor)
        - Actuators (for fast reaction/control)
        - Controllers (manual changes)
    - **PLC**: Programmable Logic Controllers

- Control networks typically:
    - Do not need high bandwidth: data rate transfer is not high

- Theoretically, PLC is able to be far away from sensors and actuators.
- *Data Diode*
    - One way data flow
    
- SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
    - **PLC is programmed for immediate reaction to dangerous situations**
    
- In a spanning tree with switches, there are always 2 directions
    - Port pointing down, further into tree is **DP**, Designated port
    - Port pointing up, to root, is **RP**, Root port.
