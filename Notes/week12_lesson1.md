# Data Center Networking

- Slide 14:
    - Bottlenecks may become a problem, since
    the bandwidth is shared by multiple server racks.
    - One possible solution is to have highly interconnected 
    topology 

- Slide 21:
    - What is a Network Operating System? (NOP)
        - Not fully idealised yet, theoretical

- Four key characteristics: slide 26
    - Flow based activities (MACs, Eth type, VLAN id, IP, ...)
        - In a tuple of many variables
        - Currently can go up to 40 variables
            - Check slide 38 for 12 current variables
    - Separation of Data Plane and Control Plane
    - Network Control Functions external to Data Plane Switches
    - Programmable Network (logically centralized, but actually
    distributed)
        - Routing
        - Access Control
        - Packet blocking
        - Load balancing 
        
- Slide 31 - OpenFlow protocol
    - Use this to study about the abstraction of application layer logic with 
    controllers at the lower layers
    
- Note that switching device is a generic term for:
    - Switch
    - Router
