# Wireless medium

Key Differences to wired:
- Wireless communications take the place of devices connected
locally.


There are theoretically infinite bands
- Each band governed by different regulations
- For profitability, use rights of new bands can be
sold for alot of money

Current Issues: 
- **inteference possible**. Since the signal
frequencies are shared, inteference/corruption possible
- **Weak signal strength**
- **multipath propagation** 
(reflection off surfaces, arrival time undetermined/different)

Ad-Hoc: 
- No access to internet
- Still require connection to other devices

Protocols for "giving way" to each other for wireless 
communication:
- Discrete timeslots for transmission
- Can either be coordinated or not (refer slides 28-29)
    - coordinated: timeslot wasted if not used
    - probabilistic algorithm for sending
- 2 main: 
    - Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
        - by time multiplexing
    - Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
        - listen before speaking, do not interrupt
